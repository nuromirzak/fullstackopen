### a. Introduction to React

> The first rule of frontend web development:
>> *keep the console open all the time*
>
> Let us repeat this together: *I promise to keep the console open all the time* during this course, and for the rest of my life when I'm doing web development.

> when writing JSX, the tag needs to be closed

> Software development is hard. It gets even harder if one is not using all the possible available tools such as the web-console and debug printing with `console.log`. Professionals use both all the time and there is no single reason why a beginner should not adopt the use of these wonderful helper methods that will make life so much easier.

> First letter of React component names must be capitalized

### b. JavaScript

> In certain circles, it has also been popular to attempt "simulating" Java features and design patterns in JavaScript. We do not recommend doing this as the languages and respective ecosystems are ultimately very different.

> When using React, techniques from functional programming are often used. One characteristic of the functional programming paradigm is the use of immutable data structures. In React code, it is preferable to use the method concat, which creates a new array with the added item.
